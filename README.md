*Yet another e-commerce attempt nobody asked for.*

## What is it?
A doomed Amazon clone built with outdated tech nobody wants to maintain.

## Features
- Products nobody will buy
- Shopping cart that probably breaks
- Payment integration that might work (sometimes)
- User accounts nobody will create

## Tech Stack
- PHP (because we hate ourselves)
- MySQL (it was free)
- JavaScript/AJAX (poorly implemented)
- PHPMailer (emails will go to spam)
- PayMob integration (when it feels like working)

## Setup
1. Clone repo
2. Configure stuff
3. Give up

## Contributors
Just me, alone with my regrets.
